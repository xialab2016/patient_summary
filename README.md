# Using large language models to produce patient-friendly summaries of multiple sclerosis clinical notes

## Readability

For the clinical note and the summaries produced by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we obtained the following readability measures:
1. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
2. Gunning Fog Index

The code to obtain these measures can be found at Readability_final.R.
